# WorkHorz
A revolutionary new web-app engine written in modern C++ offering easy access via LUA and designed to be used by
small on 1 server to large enterprise application with easy scaling and top performance by design. More details will
be added as the project progresses and are ready to test. WorkHorz is developer-friendly giving easy access to the
code in a way developers are used to, making customization and extending the engine fast and fun.

- **Innovation**: We are always looking for new ways to improve the engine and make it even better.

use easily.

## Current State Of Affairs
WorkHorz is currently in the very early stages of development and is not ready at all for production use! No support
is provided at this stage, the code is provided as-is and may not even build always on your machine. We use state of
the art technology and libraries and may refactor the code at any time.

We are looking for contributors to help us build this engine, if you are interested in contributing please contact
us letting us know what you would like to work on and what your strengths and expertise are.
