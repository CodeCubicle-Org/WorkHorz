# WorkHorz

A revolutionary new web-app engine written in modern C++ 23/26 offering easy access via LUA 5.4 and designed to be
used by a small team or individual on 1 server up to a large enterprise application, with several teams offering easy
scaling and top performance by design. More details will be added as the project progresses and is ready to test.
WorkHorz is developer-friendly, giving easy access to the code in a way developers are used to, making customization
and extending the engine fast and fun.

## Main Goals & Philosophy
- **Performance**: The engine is designed to be extremely fast and efficient without much extra efforts.
- **Scalability**: The engine is designed to be easily scalable, from DevOps tools to big enterprise applications.
- **Ease of Use**: The easy to use is a core feature to offer everyone access to it be it through LUA or C++.
- **Flexibility**: Flexibility puts a strong a focus on customization to suit all your needs one way or another.
- **Security**: The engine is designed to be as secure as possible, taking care of a lot of details that are hard to
implement.
- **Reliability**: The engine is designed to be reliable and predictable, because your business depends on it to be.
- **OpenSource**: The core engine is available for free to everyone, but we also offer commercial support and
services.
- **Community**: We are building a community around the engine to help each other and share knowledge and experience.
- **Innovation**: We are always looking for new ways to improve the engine and make it even better.
- **Marketplace**: User can offer their code snippets, nodes or complete web-apps in the marketplace for others to
use easily.

## Current State Of Affairs
WorkHorz is currently in the very early stages of development and is not ready at all for production use! No support
is provided at this stage, the code is provided as-is and may not even build always on your machine. We use state of
the art technology and libraries and may refactor the code at any time.
We are looking for contributors to help us build this engine, if you are interested in contributing please contact
us letting us know what you would like to work on and what your strengths and expertise are.
