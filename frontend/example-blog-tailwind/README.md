# Example Blog Tailwing

This is an example blog built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
The code was generated in part with the help of Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.5. It's part of an experiment on how generative AI can be used to change the development workflow of web applications.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev # for development

```
